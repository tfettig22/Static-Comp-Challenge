# Static Comp Challenge #

Solo challenge Mod 2 week 3

For this challenge I have re-created an image of a website, following all of the layout as closely as possible. I have decided to change the logo and some of the images so that the website looks like it hold a collection of playlits from some of my favorite music producers.  There is no JavaScript in the project, only HTML and CSS.  Below are images of the static comp that I started with, and then the result with my own images and some altered text.  My website gets a 7/8 lighthouse score, the only area that is lacking is the color contrast, which I decided to leave as-is because it closely matches the comp we were given to re-create.
